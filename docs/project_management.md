## Project management
In this document we present the project management.

### Tasks/meetings
Every week we try to have one or two meetings. The dates of these meetings are given in our trello board in Trello.

In our trello board all tasks are defined and get checked off when they are finished. You can find our Trello board here [Add hyper link].
